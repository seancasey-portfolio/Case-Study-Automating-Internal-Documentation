# Case Study: Automating Internal Reports & Documentation

### **What This Method Achieves for Your Organisation**

This case study demonstrates a simple, automated workflow that helps your team preserve its institutional memory and reduce administrative overhead.

*   **Saves valuable staff and volunteer time** by automating the high-friction task of summarising long documents and writing up meeting notes.
*   **Preserves critical institutional memory** by transforming messy, conversational discussions into clean, structured summaries that can be easily archived and searched.
*   **Improves operational efficiency and clarity** by ensuring that key decisions, action items, and project updates are always accessible and easy to find, reducing the risk of knowledge being lost in email chains.

### **Practical, Real-World Use Cases**

This workflow is designed to handle common administrative burdens that drain time and energy from your mission:

*   **Automated Meeting Summaries:** Automatically transform a raw, 90-minute meeting transcript into a concise, bullet-point summary with a clear list of action items and key decisions.
*   **Consolidating Project Updates:** Take a long and disjointed email chain about a project and automatically synthesise it into a single, clean progress report.
*   **Building a Searchable Knowledge Base:** Create a simple, searchable archive of your organisation's key decisions by processing board minutes or strategic plans into easily digestible summaries.

### **The Technical Approach: A High-Level Look at the Method**

This workflow uses a supervised software tool to act as a "digital chronicler." The process is designed to be simple and reliable:

1.  **Step 1: It reads the document to understand the main topics.** The process begins by having the tool read the entire source document (for example, a long meeting transcript). Its first job is not to summarise, but simply to identify the key themes that were discussed.

2.  **Step 2: It finds and pulls out the most important sentences.** Once the main topics are identified, the tool performs a second, more focused pass. **Using criteria defined by a human user,** it re-reads the document, this time specifically looking for the most important and relevant sentences related to each of those key topics.

3.  **Step 3: It writes a clear, structured summary.** With the critical information now extracted, the tool's final job is to act as a technical writer. It uses that key information to author a new, clean, and well-structured summary, following a simple, pre-defined template (e.g., "Key Decisions," "Action Items," "Next Steps"). This ensures the final output is a useful, actionable document, not just a block of text.
